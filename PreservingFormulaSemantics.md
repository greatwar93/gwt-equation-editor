# **Preserving formula semantics** - what does that mean ? #

In short - you can use entered formulas to make real calculations.
But there's more. :)

# Details #

In many common equation editors:
  * How one can distinguish upper index of a variable from raising that variable to the specified power ?
  * Whether brackets mean operator precedence or a vector value ?

Automatic hints of, for example:
  * inappropriate function application (sinus of not an angle in geometry)
  * inappropriate operations (sum of an angle and length, or of a money and weight).

And we are also going to implement some special marks - for example those that one use to mark formula simplification steps.
